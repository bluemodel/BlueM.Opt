# BlueM.Opt
BlueM.Opt is an optimization framework that can be coupled with an arbitrary simulation software.

The optimization parameters, objective functions and (optionally) contraints can be defined in a flexible manner.

Optimization results are stored in a database.

BlueM.Opt integrates a graphing feature for displaying the optimization progress and results. Optimization results can also be analyzed in detail.

Where possible, BlueM.Opt utilizes multithreading in order to evaluate multiple parameter sets simultaneously.
